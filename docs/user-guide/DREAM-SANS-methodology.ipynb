    "The DREAM-polarizer is a movable in-situ SEOP<sup>[1]</sup> <sup>3</sup>He-cell [Ref. 1] of which the neutron polarization $P^{^3\\textup{He, p}}$ has to be pre-characterized in commissioning measurements and inserted into this workflow.\n",
    "Its wavelength-independent opacity $O^{\\textup{0, p}}$, empty-glass transmission $T^{\\textup{g, p}}$, pre-factor of nuclear polarization $C^{\\textup{p}}$, and its time-decay constant $T^{\\textup{1, p}}$ can be measured once in every commissioning time via Workflow 2 of \"SANS Polarization Analysis Methodology\". \n",

    "Note: Workflow 1 of \"SANS Polarization Analysis Methodology\" can be adapted to include the usage of the DREAM polarizer. Changes that have to be made are that the wavelength-independent pre-factor of opacity ($O^{0, p}$), empty-glass transmission 9$T^{\\textup{g}, p}(\\lambda)$), the pre-factor of nuclear polarization exponential decay of <sup>3</sup>He-polarizer ($C^{p}$), and the decay constant of nuclear polarization exponential decay of <sup>3</sup>He-polarizer ($T^{1, cell}$ ), are constant and do not have to be determined by neither Workflow 1, nor Workflow 2 (they can be simply taken out). Instead, the above mentioned sudden fluctuations can occur spontaneously, for which an error message has to be inserted into Workflow 1. "
